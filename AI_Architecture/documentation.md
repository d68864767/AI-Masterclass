# AI Architecture Documentation

This document provides an overview of the AI Architecture section of the AI Masterclass project. The goal of this section is to explore various AI architectures, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and convolutional networks. We implement these architectures from scratch and explain their working principles.

## Code Overview

The code for this section is written in Python and uses the TensorFlow library to implement the AI architectures. The main file is `code.py`, which contains the implementation of a feedforward network as an example.

### FeedForwardNetwork Class

The `FeedForwardNetwork` class is a subclass of the `Sequential` class from the `tensorflow.keras.models` module. This class represents a feedforward network, which is the simplest form of artificial neural network.

In a feedforward network, the information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any), and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

The `FeedForwardNetwork` class has the following structure:

- The `__init__` method initializes the network. It adds a dense layer with `HIDDEN_DIM` neurons and `INPUT_DIM` input dimensions. The activation function for this layer is ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit). Then, it adds another dense layer with `OUTPUT_DIM` neurons. The activation function for this layer is softmax, which is often used for multi-class classification problems.

### Constants

The code defines several constants:

- `INPUT_DIM`: The dimension of the input data. This is set to 100.
- `HIDDEN_DIM`: The number of neurons in the hidden layer. This is set to 50.
- `OUTPUT_DIM`: The number of neurons in the output layer. This is set to 10.

## Tutorial Overview

The tutorial for this section is provided in the `tutorial.md` file. It provides a detailed explanation of the AI architectures covered in this section, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and convolutional networks. It also explains the code implementation of these architectures.

## Conclusion

The AI Architecture section of the AI Masterclass project provides a comprehensive overview of various AI architectures. It includes a Python implementation of these architectures and a detailed tutorial explaining their working principles. This section serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in learning about AI architectures and their implementation.
