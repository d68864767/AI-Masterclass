# AI Architecture Tutorial

Welcome to the AI Architecture section of the AI Masterclass. In this tutorial, we will explore various AI architectures, including feedforward networks, recurrent networks, and convolutional networks. We will implement these architectures from scratch and explain their working principles.

## Feedforward Networks

Feedforward networks are the simplest form of artificial neural network. In a feedforward network, the information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any), and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.

Let's start by implementing a simple feedforward network using TensorFlow.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Activation

# Define constants
INPUT_DIM = 100  # Input dimension
HIDDEN_DIM = 50  # Hidden layer dimension
OUTPUT_DIM = 10  # Output dimension

# Define your feedforward network
class FeedForwardNetwork(Sequential):
    def __init__(self):
        super(FeedForwardNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.add(Dense(HIDDEN_DIM, input_dim=INPUT_DIM, activation='relu'))
        self.add(Dense(OUTPUT_DIM, activation='softmax'))
```

In the above code, we first import the necessary libraries. We then define some constants for our network, such as the input dimension, hidden layer dimension, and output dimension. We then define our feedforward network as a class that inherits from the `Sequential` class in Keras. In the constructor of our class, we add a hidden layer and an output layer to our network.

The hidden layer is a `Dense` layer, which means that it is fully connected to the input layer. The `relu` activation function is used in the hidden layer. The output layer is also a `Dense` layer and uses the `softmax` activation function, which is commonly used for multi-class classification problems.

In the next tutorials, we will explore more complex AI architectures, such as recurrent networks and convolutional networks. Stay tuned!
