# Text Generation Documentation

## Overview

The text generation module of the AI Masterclass project focuses on implementing a text generation model using the GPT-2 model from the transformers library. The goal of this module is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how text generation models work and how they can be implemented using modern libraries like transformers and PyTorch.

## Code Structure

The code for this module is structured as follows:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: We start by importing the necessary libraries. This includes the transformers library for the GPT-2 model and tokenizer, PyTorch for model training and data handling, and other standard Python libraries.

2. **Define constants**: We define several constants that will be used throughout the code. This includes the name of the model we're using (GPT-2), the tokenizer for this model, and the device we're running our code on (CPU or GPU).

3. **Define your dataset**: We define a PyTorch Dataset for our text data. This dataset takes a list of texts as input and implements the necessary methods for a PyTorch Dataset (`__len__` and `__getitem__`).

4. **Model training and evaluation**: The rest of the code is dedicated to training and evaluating our text generation model. This includes defining our training and evaluation loops, initializing our model and optimizer, and running our training and evaluation epochs.

## Tutorial

For a step-by-step guide on how to use this code, please refer to the [Text Generation Tutorial](./tutorial.md) in this directory. This tutorial provides a detailed walkthrough of the code, explaining how each part works and how to use it to train and evaluate a text generation model.

## Prerequisites

To understand and use this code, you should have:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of deep learning concepts
- Familiarity with PyTorch and the transformers library

## Future Work

While this code provides a basic implementation of a text generation model, there are several ways it could be expanded:

- Implementing different text generation models: While we use GPT-2 in this code, there are many other text generation models available. Future work could involve implementing these other models and comparing their performance.

- Fine-tuning the model: Our code uses a pre-trained GPT-2 model without any fine-tuning. Future work could involve fine-tuning the model on a specific task or dataset to improve its performance.

- Exploring different text generation techniques: There are many different techniques for generating text, including sampling methods, beam search, and others. Future work could involve implementing and comparing these different techniques.
