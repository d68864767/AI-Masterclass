# Machine Learning Tutorial

Welcome to the Machine Learning section of the AI Masterclass. In this tutorial, we will cover the fundamentals of machine learning, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. We will implement classic ML algorithms and discuss their applications.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the model learns from labeled training data, and makes predictions based on that data. A common example of supervised learning is classification, where the model categorizes input data into one of several predefined classes.

In the accompanying code, we have implemented a few examples of supervised learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

### Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression is a statistical model used for binary classification problems. It uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.

```python
# Logistic Regression
logistic_regression = LogisticRegression(random_state=RANDOM_STATE)
logistic_regression.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_lr = logistic_regression.predict(X_test)
```

### Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees at training time and outputting the class that is the mode of the classes of the individual trees.

```python
# Random Forest
random_forest = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=RANDOM_STATE)
random_forest.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_rf = random_forest.predict(X_test)
```

### Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression, and outliers detection. They are effective in high dimensional spaces and are versatile as different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function.

```python
# Support Vector Machines (SVM)
svc = SVC(random_state=RANDOM_STATE)
svc.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred_svc = svc.predict(X_test)
```

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. Examples of unsupervised learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to behave in an environment, by performing certain actions and observing the results/rewards/results. The agent learns from the consequences of its actions, rather than from being explicitly taught and it selects its actions on basis of its past experiences (exploitation) and also by new choices (exploration).

In the upcoming sections, we will dive deeper into these topics and provide more hands-on examples. Stay tuned!
