# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or the spoken word. RNNs are called recurrent because they perform the same task for every element of a sequence, with the output being dependent on the previous computations.

## Introduction to RNNs <a name="introduction"></a>

RNNs are networks with loops in them, allowing information to persist. In other words, they have a 'memory' which captures information about what has been calculated so far. In theory, RNNs can make use of information in arbitrarily long sequences, but in practice, they are limited to looking back only a few steps due to the problem of vanishing gradients.

## Vanishing and Exploding Gradients <a name="gradients"></a>

The vanishing and exploding gradient phenomena are often encountered in the context of RNNs. The reason these problems occur is that the gradient of the loss function decays exponentially with time (vanishing) or increases exponentially with time (exploding) due to the multiplicative factor involved in their computation.

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks <a name="lstm"></a>

LSTM networks are a type of RNN that are designed to remember long-term dependencies. They were introduced by Hochreiter & Schmidhuber (1997), and were refined and popularized by many people in following work. They work tremendously well on a large variety of problems and are now widely used.

## Implementing RNNs <a name="implementation"></a>

In the accompanying `code.py` file, we have provided a basic implementation of an RNN from scratch, as well as using popular deep learning libraries like TensorFlow and PyTorch. We have also provided examples of LSTM networks and how to train them.

## Applications of RNNs <a name="applications"></a>

RNNs are used in a variety of applications including:

- Speech Recognition
- Language Modeling
- Translation
- Image Captioning

The power of RNNs comes from their ability to recognize patterns in sequential data and their ability to store past information. This is particularly useful in tasks where context is important for understanding the data.

For more details, please refer to the `tutorial.md` file where we have provided a step-by-step guide on how to implement and use RNNs for various tasks.
