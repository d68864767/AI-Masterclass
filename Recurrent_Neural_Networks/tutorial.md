# Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), a type of artificial neural network designed to recognize patterns in sequences of data, such as text, genomes, handwriting, or the spoken word. RNNs are particularly useful for tasks where the sequence of the input data matters, such as language translation and speech recognition.

## What are Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)?

RNNs are a type of neural network where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a sequence. This allows it to exhibit temporal dynamic behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs.

## How do RNNs work?

RNNs process data by iterating through the elements of a sequence and maintaining a "state" containing information relative to what it has seen so far. In other words, RNNs have a form of memory. They save the output of processing nodes and feed the result back into the model. This is how RNNs can predict what's coming next.

## Implementing a Simple RNN using TensorFlow

In the `Recurrent_Neural_Networks/code.py` file, we have implemented a simple RNN using TensorFlow's Keras API. Let's break down the code:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import SimpleRNN, Dense, Activation

# Define constants
INPUT_DIM = 100  # Input dimension
HIDDEN_DIM = 50  # Hidden layer dimension
OUTPUT_DIM = 10  # Output dimension
TIME_STEPS = 20  # Time steps for RNN

# Define your recurrent neural network
class RecurrentNetwork(Sequential):
    def __init__(self):
        super(RecurrentNetwork, self).__init__()
        self.add(SimpleRNN(HIDDEN_DIM, input_shape=(TIME_STEPS, INPUT_DIM), activation='relu'))
        self.add(Dense(OUTPUT_DIM, activation='softmax'))
```

In the code above, we first import the necessary libraries. We then define some constants for our network, such as the input dimension, hidden layer dimension, output dimension, and the number of time steps for our RNN.

We then define our RNN model as a class that inherits from the `Sequential` class. In the constructor of our class, we first call the constructor of the `Sequential` class using `super()`. We then add a `SimpleRNN` layer to our model with `HIDDEN_DIM` units and an input shape of `(TIME_STEPS, INPUT_DIM)`. We use the ReLU activation function for our RNN layer. Finally, we add a `Dense` layer with `OUTPUT_DIM` units and the softmax activation function.

## Conclusion

RNNs are a powerful tool for sequence data and have been used successfully in many applications. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, which makes them difficult to train. In the next tutorial, we will explore Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of RNN that is designed to combat the vanishing gradient problem.
