# Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), two powerful unsupervised learning models in the field of deep learning. We will implement these models using TensorFlow and apply them to the MNIST dataset.

## Autoencoders

Autoencoders are neural networks that aim to copy their inputs to their outputs. They work by compressing the input into a latent-space representation, and then reconstructing the output from this representation.

### Implementation

We start by importing the necessary libraries and loading the MNIST dataset. We normalize all values between 0 and 1 and flatten the images.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, _), (x_test, _) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Normalize all values between 0 and 1
x_train = x_train.astype('float32') / 255.
x_test = x_test.astype('float32') / 255.

# Flatten the images
x_train = x_train.reshape((len(x_train), np.prod(x_train.shape[1:])))
x_test = x_test.reshape((len(x_test), np.prod(x_test.shape[1:])))
```

## Variational Autoencoders

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a kind of generative model thatâ€™s especially appropriate for the task of image editing via concept vectors. They are a modern take on autoencoders -- a type of network that aims to "encode" an input to a low-dimensional latent space then "decode" it back.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned about Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders, two powerful unsupervised learning models in deep learning. We have implemented these models using TensorFlow and applied them to the MNIST dataset. We encourage you to experiment with these models and see how they can be used in various applications.
