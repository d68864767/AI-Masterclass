# GPT-4 Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the GPT-4 implementation in our AI Masterclass project. The GPT-4 model is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI. It is an extension of the GPT-3 model, with improvements in language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Code Structure

The code for the GPT-4 implementation is structured as follows:

- **Importing necessary libraries**: We import the necessary libraries for the implementation. This includes the transformers library for the GPT-4 model, the PyTorch library for tensor computations and the DataLoader for handling the dataset.

- **Defining constants**: We define constants for the model name, tokenizer, and device. The model name is set to 'gpt2' for now, but should be changed to 'gpt4' once it's available. The tokenizer is used to convert text into tokens that the model can understand. The device is set to 'cuda' if a GPU is available, otherwise it's set to 'cpu'.

- **Defining the dataset**: We define a PyTorch Dataset for our text data. The Dataset class is a way to provide an interface for accessing all the training or testing samples in your dataset. Our dataset takes a list of texts as input and implements the `__len__` and `__getitem__` methods.

## Prerequisites

To understand and run the code, you need:

- A basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with PyTorch and the transformers library.
- Understanding of language models, specifically the GPT models.

## Running the Code

To run the code, follow the instructions in the tutorial.md file. Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed and understood.

## Future Work

The current implementation is a basic version of the GPT-4 model. Future work could include:

- Fine-tuning the model for specific tasks.
- Implementing a custom training loop.
- Adding more sophisticated data preprocessing.
