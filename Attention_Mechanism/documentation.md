# Attention Mechanism Documentation

## Overview

The Attention Mechanism is a critical component in many state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including the Transformer and GPT families. It allows models to focus on different parts of the input sequence when producing an output, thereby improving the model's ability to handle long sequences and capture long-range dependencies.

This directory contains the implementation of the MultiHeadAttention class, which is a key component of the attention mechanism.

## File Structure

- `code.py`: This file contains the Python code for implementing the MultiHeadAttention class.
- `tutorial.md`: This file provides a step-by-step tutorial on how the attention mechanism works and how to use the MultiHeadAttention class.
- `documentation.md`: This file (the one you're reading) provides an overview of the attention mechanism and describes the contents of this directory.

## Code Description

The `code.py` file contains the implementation of the MultiHeadAttention class. This class is a PyTorch module that implements the multi-head attention mechanism, a key component of Transformer models.

The MultiHeadAttention class has the following methods:

- `__init__(self, embedding_size, num_heads)`: This method initializes the MultiHeadAttention object. It takes the size of the embeddings and the number of attention heads as arguments.
- `forward(self, query, key, value, mask)`: This method performs the forward pass of the multi-head attention mechanism. It takes the query, key, and value tensors, as well as an optional mask tensor, as arguments.

The `code.py` file also includes a `ScaledDotProductAttention` class, which is used by the MultiHeadAttention class to compute the attention scores.

## Tutorial Description

The `tutorial.md` file provides a step-by-step tutorial on how the attention mechanism works and how to use the MultiHeadAttention class. It starts with an introduction to the attention mechanism, explaining its purpose and how it improves upon previous sequence-to-sequence models. It then goes into detail on the multi-head attention mechanism, explaining how it works and why it is beneficial. Finally, it provides a walkthrough of the code in `code.py`, explaining how to use the MultiHeadAttention class and what each part of the code does.

## How to Use

To use the MultiHeadAttention class, you need to import it from `code.py`. You can then create a MultiHeadAttention object by specifying the size of the embeddings and the number of attention heads. You can use this object in your Transformer models by calling its `forward` method with the appropriate arguments.

## Dependencies

This code depends on the PyTorch library. Make sure you have PyTorch installed before running the code.
