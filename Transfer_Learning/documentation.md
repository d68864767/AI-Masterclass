# Transfer Learning Documentation

## Overview
Transfer learning is a machine learning technique where a pre-trained model is used as the starting point for a new related task. This technique is particularly useful in deep learning due to the large computational resources required to train deep neural networks. By using a model pre-trained on a large dataset, we can leverage learned features without requiring a large amount of data or computational resources.

In this part of the project, we implement transfer learning using the VGG16 model, a pre-trained model developed by the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford, which has been trained on the ImageNet dataset.

## Code Implementation

### Importing Libraries
We start by importing the necessary libraries. We use TensorFlow for building our model and pickle for loading our data.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import pickle
```

### Constants
We define some constants for our model. `INPUT_SHAPE` is the shape of the input images, and `NUM_CLASSES` is the number of output classes.

```python
INPUT_SHAPE = (50, 50, 3)
NUM_CLASSES = 10
```

### Loading and Normalizing Data
We load our data using pickle and normalize it by dividing by 255.

```python
X = pickle.load(open("X.pickle", "rb"))
y = pickle.load(open("y.pickle", "rb"))
X = X/255.0
```

### Model Architecture
We use the VGG16 model as our base model. We remove the top layers of the model as they are specific to the ImageNet dataset. We then add a Flatten layer to flatten the output of the VGG16 model, followed by a Dense layer with 256 units and ReLU activation function. We also add a Dropout layer for regularization, and finally, we add a Dense layer with `NUM_CLASSES` units and softmax activation function for our output layer.

```python
base_model = VGG16(weights='imagenet', include_top=False, input_shape=INPUT_SHAPE)
x = base_model.output
x = Flatten()(x)
x = Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)
x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
predictions = Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation='softmax')(x)
model = Model(inputs=base_model.input, outputs=predictions)
```

### Compiling the Model
We compile our model using the Adam optimizer, categorical crossentropy as our loss function, and accuracy as our metric.

```python
model.compile(optimizer=Adam(), loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
```

### Training the Model
We train our model using our data. We use a batch size of 32 and train for 10 epochs.

```python
model.fit(X, y, batch_size=32, epochs=10)
```

## Conclusion
This code demonstrates how to implement transfer learning using a pre-trained VGG16 model in TensorFlow. By using transfer learning, we can leverage the power of deep learning models even with limited data or computational resources.
