# Transfer Learning Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will explore the concept of transfer learning and how it can be applied in deep learning models. Transfer learning is a technique where a pre-trained model is used on a new problem. It's popular in deep learning because it can train deep neural networks with comparatively little data.

## What is Transfer Learning?

Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks.

## Why Transfer Learning?

Training a deep learning model requires a lot of data. But what if we don't have enough data? Here comes the role of transfer learning. In transfer learning, we leverage the knowledge of a pre-trained model for our problem. The pre-trained model has been trained on a large dataset, and it has learned a good feature extractor. We can use this feature extractor for our problem.

## How to Implement Transfer Learning?

In this tutorial, we will use the VGG16 model, a model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset â€” a large dataset of web images with 1000 classes. Since the ImageNet dataset contains several "animal" classes, this model will already have learned features that are relevant to our classification problem.

Here is a high-level overview of the steps to implement transfer learning:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: We will need the tensorflow library for this task. We will also use the VGG16 model from tensorflow.keras.applications.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.applications import VGG16
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
import pickle
```

2. **Load and preprocess your data**: You need to load your data and preprocess it. In our case, we are normalizing our data.

```python
# Load your data
X = pickle.load(open("X.pickle", "rb"))
y = pickle.load(open("y.pickle", "rb"))

# Normalize data
X = X/255.0
```

3. **Load the pre-trained model**: We will load the VGG16 model with pre-trained ImageNet weights, excluding the top layer.

```python
baseModel = VGG16(weights="imagenet", include_top=False, input_tensor=Input(shape=INPUT_SHAPE))
```

4. **Build and train your model**: Now, we will add our Dense layer and compile the model. After that, we will train our model.

```python
headModel = baseModel.output
headModel = Flatten(name="flatten")(headModel)
headModel = Dense(512, activation="relu")(headModel)
headModel = Dropout(0.5)(headModel)
headModel = Dense(NUM_CLASSES, activation="softmax")(headModel)

# place the head FC model on top of the base model (this will become the actual model we will train)
model = Model(inputs=baseModel.input, outputs=headModel)

# compile our model (this needs to be done after our setting our layers to being non-trainable)
print("[INFO] compiling model...")
opt = Adam(lr=INIT_LR, decay=INIT_LR / EPOCHS)
model.compile(loss="binary_crossentropy", optimizer=opt, metrics=["accuracy"])

# train the head of the network for a few epochs (all other layers are frozen) -- this will allow the new FC layers to start to become initialized with actual "learned" values versus pure random
print("[INFO] training head...")
H = model.fit(
    aug.flow(trainX, trainY, batch_size=BS),
    steps_per_epoch=len(trainX) // BS,
    validation_data=(testX, testY),
    validation_steps=len(testX) // BS,
    epochs=EPOCHS)
```

5. **Evaluate your model**: Finally, you can evaluate your model on your test data.

```python
print("[INFO] evaluating network...")
predictions = model.predict(testX, batch_size=BS)
print(classification_report(testY.argmax(axis=1), predictions.argmax(axis=1), target_names=lb.classes_))
```

That's it! You have successfully implemented transfer learning. This is a powerful technique that can help you leverage pre-trained models to solve your problems with less data and computational resources.
