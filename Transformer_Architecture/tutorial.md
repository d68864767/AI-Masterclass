# Transformer Architecture Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will be exploring the Transformer architecture, a key component in many state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) models, including the GPT and BERT families.

## Introduction

The Transformer model, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al., is a type of model architecture used in the field of deep learning for tasks such as translation and text summarization. Unlike traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), Transformers do not require sequential data. This property allows them to process input data in parallel, significantly improving efficiency.

## Code Explanation

Let's break down the code snippet provided in the `Transformer_Architecture/code.py` file.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torch.nn import TransformerEncoder, TransformerEncoderLayer
```

Here, we import the necessary libraries. We use PyTorch as our deep learning framework and import the TransformerEncoder and TransformerEncoderLayer classes from PyTorch's nn module.

```python
# Define constants
EMBEDDING_SIZE = 512  # Embedding size
NHEAD = 8  # the number of heads in the multiheadattention models
NUM_LAYERS = 6  # the number of sub-encoder-layers in the transformer encoder
DROPOUT = 0.1  # the dropout value
DEVICE = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

Next, we define several constants that we will use in our Transformer model. These include the embedding size, the number of heads in the multihead attention models, the number of sub-encoder layers in the transformer encoder, the dropout value, and the device we will use for computations.

```python
class TransformerModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, ntoken, ninp, nhead, nhid, nlayers, dropout=0.5):
        super(TransformerModel, self).__init__()
        self.model_type = 'Transformer'
        self.src_mask = None
```

We then define our TransformerModel class, which inherits from PyTorch's nn.Module. In the constructor, we initialize the parent class and define some attributes.

The rest of the code defines the structure of the Transformer model and how it should process inputs. We won't go into detail here, but you can refer to the full code in the `Transformer_Architecture/code.py` file.

## Conclusion

The Transformer architecture is a powerful tool in NLP. It forms the backbone of models like GPT-2, BERT, and many others. Understanding how it works is key to understanding these models. We hope this tutorial has given you a good starting point for that understanding.

In the next part of this series, we will look at how to train this model and use it for tasks like text generation and translation. Stay tuned!
