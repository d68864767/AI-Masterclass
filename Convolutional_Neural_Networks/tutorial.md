# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow. CNNs are a class of deep learning models that are primarily used for image processing tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and more.

## What is a Convolutional Neural Network?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network designed to process data with a grid-like topology, such as an image. CNNs are composed of one or more convolutional layers, often followed by pooling layers, and then one or more fully connected layers as in a standard multilayer neural network.

The architecture of a CNN is designed to take advantage of the 2D structure of an input image (or other 2D input such as a speech signal). This is achieved with local connections and tied weights followed by some form of pooling which results in translation invariant features.

## Implementing a CNN with TensorFlow

Let's dive into the code snippet provided in `Convolutional_Neural_Networks/code.py`.

### Importing Libraries

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
```

We start by importing the necessary libraries. We use TensorFlow as our deep learning framework, and Keras, a user-friendly API for TensorFlow, to build our CNN.

### Defining Constants

```python
# Define constants
INPUT_SHAPE = (32, 32, 3)  # Input shape (e.g., for a 32x32 RGB image)
CONV_FILTERS = 32  # Number of convolution filters
CONV_KERNEL_SIZE = (3, 3)  # Size of convolution kernel
POOL_SIZE = (2, 2)  # Size of pooling window
HIDDEN_DIM = 128  # Hidden layer dimension
OUTPUT_DIM = 10  # Output dimension (e.g., for 10-class classification)
```

We define several constants that we will use in our CNN. `INPUT_SHAPE` is the shape of our input data, `CONV_FILTERS` is the number of filters in the convolutional layer, `CONV_KERNEL_SIZE` is the size of these filters, `POOL_SIZE` is the size of the pooling window in the pooling layer, `HIDDEN_DIM` is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, and `OUTPUT_DIM` is the number of classes in our classification problem.

### Defining the CNN

```python
# Define your convolutional neural network
class ConvolutionalNetwork(Sequential):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ConvolutionalNetwork, self).__init__()
        # Add layers
        self.add(Conv2D(CONV_FILTERS, CONV_KERNEL_SIZE, activation='relu', input_shape=INPUT_SHAPE))
        self.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=POOL_SIZE))
        self.add(Flatten())
        self.add(Dense(HIDDEN_DIM, activation='relu'))
        self.add(Dense(OUTPUT_DIM, activation='softmax'))
```

We define our CNN as a class that inherits from the `Sequential` model class in Keras. This allows us to build our model as a linear stack of layers. In the constructor of our class, we add our layers. We start with a `Conv2D` layer for the convolution operation, followed by a `MaxPooling2D` layer for the pooling operation. We then flatten the output from these layers with a `Flatten` layer, before passing it through a `Dense` layer (fully connected layer). Finally, we add another `Dense` layer with a softmax activation function for our output layer.

That's it! You've just implemented a Convolutional Neural Network with TensorFlow. In the next sections, we will train this model on a dataset and evaluate its performance.
