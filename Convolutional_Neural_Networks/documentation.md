# Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Documentation

## Overview
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a class of deep learning models that are primarily used for image processing tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and more. They are designed to automatically and adaptively learn spatial hierarchies of features from tasks with input data that are grid-like topology. Examples include time-series data, which can be thought of as a 1-D grid taking samples at regular time intervals, and image data, which can be thought of as a 2-D grid of pixels.

## Code Implementation
The code provided in `Convolutional_Neural_Networks/code.py` demonstrates how to implement a simple CNN using TensorFlow. The CNN model is built using the `Sequential` API, which allows you to stack layers on top of each other. The model consists of the following layers:

1. `Conv2D`: This is the convolutional layer of the CNN. It uses a set of learnable filters, which you must specify the number and size of. Each filter is convolved across the width and height of the input volume and computes dot products between the entries of the filter and the input, producing an activation map.

2. `MaxPooling2D`: This layer is used to reduce the spatial dimensions (width, height) of the input volume for the next convolutional layer. It does this by calculating the maximum value for each patch of the feature map.

3. `Flatten`: This layer flattens the input into a single dimension array, which can be fed into the fully connected (dense) layer.

4. `Dense`: These are fully connected layers, which perform classification on the features extracted by the convolutional layers and down-sampled by the pooling layers. In a fully connected layer, each neuron receives input from every element of the previous layer.
