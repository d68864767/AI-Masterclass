# Computer Vision

Welcome to the Computer Vision section of the AI Masterclass. In this section, we will explore the field of computer vision, a subfield of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world.

## Overview

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. By using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects — and then react to what they “see.”

## Topics Covered

In this section, we will cover the following topics:

1. **Object Detection**: Object detection refers to the capability of computer and software systems to locate objects in an image/scene and identify each object. We will implement object detection models and discuss their applications.

2. **Semantic Segmentation**: Semantic segmentation is a pixel-level task that assigns each pixel in an image to a class. We will implement models for semantic segmentation and discuss their applications.

3. **Instance Segmentation**: Instance segmentation is a combination of object detection and semantic segmentation. It identifies each object instance for every known class in an image. We will implement models for instance segmentation and discuss their applications.

## Files

This section contains the following files:

1. `code.py`: This file contains the Python code for implementing computer vision models.

2. `tutorial.md`: This file provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to use the code.

3. `documentation.md`: This file (the one you're reading right now) provides an overview of the concepts covered in this section.
