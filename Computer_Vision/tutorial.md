## 1. Introduction to Computer Vision

Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that trains computers to interpret and understand the visual world. By using digital images from cameras and videos and deep learning models, machines can accurately identify and classify objects and then react to what they "see."

<a name="applications"></a>
## 2. Applications of Computer Vision

Computer vision has a wide range of applications, including:

- Autonomous vehicles
- Facial recognition systems
- Medical image analysis
- Industrial quality inspection

## 3. Implementing a Basic Computer Vision Model

In this section, we will implement a basic computer vision model using a convolutional neural network (CNN). CNNs are particularly good at image analysis tasks. Our model will be trained to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Please refer to the `code.py` file in this directory for the implementation details.

## 4. Object Detection

Object detection refers to the capability of computer vision to identify objects of interest in an image or video. This is a more complex task than image classification because it also involves identifying the location of the object in the image.

Refer to the `code.py` file for an example of an object detection model.

<a name="semantic-segmentation"></a>
## 5. Semantic Segmentation

Semantic segmentation involves classifying each pixel in the image to understand the image at a pixel level. This is useful in scenarios where we need to understand the context of the objects in the image.

The `code.py` file contains an example of a semantic segmentation model.

## 6. Instance Segmentation

Instance segmentation is similar to semantic segmentation, but it also differentiates between different instances of objects. This is particularly useful in scenarios where we need to count the number of objects in an image.

Refer to the `code.py` file for an example of an instance segmentation model.

## 7. Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have covered the basics of computer vision and its applications. We have also implemented a basic computer vision model and explored more complex tasks like object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation.

Remember, the `code.py` file in this directory contains all the code used in this tutorial. Feel free to experiment with it and modify it to suit your needs.

Happy learning!
