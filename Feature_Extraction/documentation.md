# Feature Extraction Documentation

## Overview
This document provides an overview of the feature extraction module in the AI Masterclass project. The module includes Python code that demonstrates how to perform feature extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the Iris dataset.

## Dependencies
The feature extraction module depends on the following Python libraries:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

## Code Structure
The code is structured as follows:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: The required Python libraries for this module are imported.

2. **Load the Iris dataset**: The Iris dataset is loaded using the sklearn.datasets module.

3. **Standardize the features**: The features of the Iris dataset are standardized using the StandardScaler class from the sklearn.preprocessing module.

4. **Split the dataset**: The dataset is split into a training set and a test set using the train_test_split function from the sklearn.model_selection module.

5. **Apply PCA**: PCA is applied to the training set using the PCA class from the sklearn.decomposition module. The number of principal components is set to 2.

6. **Visualize the results**: The results are visualized using matplotlib. The data points are plotted in the new feature space and colored according to their class.

## Usage
To run the feature extraction code, navigate to the Feature_Extraction directory and run the following command:

```bash
python code.py
```

This will execute the code and generate a plot showing the Iris dataset in the new feature space.

## Tutorial
