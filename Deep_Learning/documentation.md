# Deep Learning Documentation

## Overview

This section of the AI Masterclass project focuses on Deep Learning, a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep") for making predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to perform the task.

The code provided in this section demonstrates how to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that are particularly effective for image classification tasks.

## Code Structure

The code is structured as follows:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: We import TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries.

2. **Define constants**: We define constants that will be used in the model. This includes the input shape for the model and the number of output classes.

3. **Load data**: We load the data that will be used to train and test the model.

4. **Normalize data**: We normalize the data to ensure that the model trains effectively.

5. **Split data**: We split the data into training and testing sets.

6. **Build the model**: We build the CNN model using Keras. The model includes several convolutional layers, max pooling layers, and dense layers.

7. **Compile the model**: We compile the model, specifying the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to be used.

8. **Train the model**: We train the model using the training data.

9. **Evaluate the model**: We evaluate the model's performance on the testing data.

10. **Save the model**: We save the trained model for future use.

## Libraries Used

- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source platform for machine learning. It provides a comprehensive ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchers push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

- **Keras**: Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python and capable of running on top of TensorFlow, CNTK, or Theano. It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation.

- **Pickle**: The pickle module implements binary protocols for serializing and de-serializing a Python object structure.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.6 or later
- TensorFlow 2.0 or later
- Keras 2.3.1 or later
- Pickle

## Running the Code

To run the code, simply navigate to the directory containing the code file and run the following command:

```bash
python Deep_Learning/code.py
```
