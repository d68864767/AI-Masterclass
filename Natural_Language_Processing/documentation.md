# Natural Language Processing Documentation

## Overview

This section of the AI Masterclass project focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP), a subfield of AI that deals with the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. The ultimate objective of NLP is to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of human language in a valuable way.

In this module, we have implemented a text classification model using the BERT model from the transformers library. The model is trained to classify text into predefined categories.

## Code Structure

The code for this module is structured as follows:

1. **Import necessary libraries**: We import the necessary libraries, including PyTorch and the transformers library, which provides us with pre-trained models for NLP tasks.

2. **Define constants**: We define constants such as the model name and the device (CPU or GPU) that we will use for computations.

3. **Define your dataset**: We define a PyTorch Dataset that will be used to load the data. The dataset takes in texts and labels as input and processes them in the `__getitem__` method.

4. **Define the model**: We define our model, which is a BERT model for sequence classification. We load a pre-trained BERT model and add a classification layer on top.

5. **Train the model**: We define a function to train our model. This function takes in the model, data loader, optimizer, and loss function as input and trains the model for a specified number of epochs.

6. **Evaluate the model**: We define a function to evaluate our model. This function takes in the model and data loader as input and computes the accuracy of the model on the input data.

7. **Main function**: In the main function, we load the data, create a data loader, define the model, optimizer, and loss function, and train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

To use this code, you need to have Python installed along with the PyTorch and transformers libraries. You can run the code using any Python IDE or from the command line using the command `python Natural_Language_Processing/code.py`.
