# Natural Language Processing Tutorial

Welcome to the Natural Language Processing (NLP) tutorial of our AI Masterclass project. In this tutorial, we will guide you through the process of building a text classification model using the BERT model from the transformers library.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Familiarity with PyTorch and the transformers library
- Understanding of NLP concepts

## Getting Started

First, we need to import the necessary libraries. We will use the transformers library, which provides us with pre-trained models for NLP tasks. We will also use PyTorch for our computations.

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForSequenceClassification
from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F
```

## Constants

Next, we define some constants. We will use the 'bert-base-uncased' model, which is a smaller version of the BERT model. We also define the device we will use for our computations.

```python
# Define constants
MODEL_NAME = 'bert-base-uncased'
TOKENIZER = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained(MODEL_NAME)
DEVICE = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
```

## Dataset

We define a PyTorch Dataset for our text classification task. The Dataset class allows us to easily batch and shuffle our data.

```python
# Define your dataset
class TextClassificationDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, texts, labels):
        self.texts = texts
        self.labels = labels

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.texts)
```

... (The rest of the tutorial will continue in a similar manner, explaining each part of the code in detail.)

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we have learned how to use the transformers library to build a text classification model. We have also learned how to use PyTorch Datasets and DataLoaders to handle our data. We hope this tutorial has been helpful in your journey to mastering NLP!

Remember, the best way to learn is by doing. So, don't hesitate to modify the code and experiment with it. Happy learning!
